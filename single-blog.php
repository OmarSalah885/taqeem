                <div class="single-blog_content--paragraph">
                    <h2>A Walk Through History</h2>
                    <p>Amman’s history stretches back thousands of years, and
                        its ancient sites are a testament to its rich past.
                        Start your journey at the Citadel (Jabal al-Qal’a),
                        perched on one of the city’s seven hills. Here, you’ll
                        find the remains of the Temple of Hercules, a Byzantine
                        church, and the Umayyad Palace. The panoramic views of
                        the city from this vantage point are breathtaking.
                        Next, visit the Roman Theatre, a 2nd-century
                        amphitheater that still hosts cultural events today.
                        Nearby, you can explore the Jordan Folklore Museum and
                        the Jordan Museum of Popular Traditions, which showcase
                        artifacts and costumes from Jordan’s diverse
                        heritage.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="single-blog_content--paragraph">
                    <h2>Cultural Immersion</h2>
                    <p> For a taste of Jordanian culture, wander through the
                        bustling streets of Downtown Amman. The markets (or
                        souks) are a sensory delight, brimming with vibrant
                        textiles, fragrant spices, and intricate handicrafts.
                        Don’t forget to stop by the Al-Balad Theatre, which
                        often features local music, film screenings, and art
                        exhibitions.
                        A visit to the Royal Automobile Museum offers a unique
                        glimpse into the history of the Hashemite Kingdom
                        through an impressive collection of classic and luxury
                        cars.</p>

                <div class="single-blog_content--paragraph">
                    <h2>Culinary Delights</h2>
                    <p> Amman is a paradise for food lovers. Start your culinary
                        adventure with a traditional Jordanian breakfast of
                        hummus, fatteh, and falafel at one of the city’s iconic
                        eateries, like Hashem Restaurant. For lunch, savor a
                        plate of mansaf, Jordan’s national dish, made with lamb
                        cooked in a tangy yogurt sauce and served with rice.
                        Craving sweets? Try kunafa, a cheese-filled pastry
                        soaked in syrup, at Habibah Sweets, a local favorite.
                        Pair it with a cup of Arabic coffee or mint tea for the
                        ultimate indulgence.</p>

                    <h2>Day Trips from Amman</h2>
                    <p>Amman’s central location makes it an excellent base for
                        exploring Jordan’s other attractions. A short drive
                        away, you can visit the ancient city of Jerash, known
                        for its remarkably preserved Roman ruins. The Dead Sea,
                        famed for its mineral-rich waters and therapeutic mud,
                        is also within easy reach.
                        For those seeking adventure, a trip to Wadi Mujib offers

                    <h2>Tips for Travelers</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Dress Modestly: While Amman is a modern city, it’s
                            respectful to dress modestly, especially when

                        <li>Learn Basic Arabic Phrases: Jordanians are warm and
                            hospitable, and a few Arabic words like “Marhaba”
                            (hello) and “Shukran” (thank you) can go a long
                            way.</li>
                        <li>Use Ride-Hailing Apps: Getting around Amm an is
